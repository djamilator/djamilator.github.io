My primary research areas of interest include epidemiology, as well as, population dynamics. I am particularly interested in studying the dynamic of infectious diseases. Currently, I am working in the transmission and spread of the Chikungunya disease. The aim was to formulate and study several mathematical models describing both, the vector population dynamics and the transmission virus to human population. More precisely, I have applied and studied dynamical systems in the case of the chikungunya epidemic that occurred in 2005-2006 on the Réunion Island, a French island in the Indian Ocean. These models use ordinary differential equations, delay differential equations, optimal control theory and metapopulation models.

These last years, several infectious diseases have appeared or re-appeared. This is not a new phenomenon and many factors have influence the emergence or re-emergence of such diseases, as the increase of international travels or climatic changes… The study of (re)emergent diseases is relatively recent, since the concept of “Emerging infectious diseases” was introduced by S.Morse in the 1990’s.

The chikungunya is a tropical disease caused by an arbovirus (arthropod-borne virus) transmitted by mosquitoes from Aedes genus. For 50 years, several epidemics have been reported in Africa and Asia. After a break of twenty years, these epidemics have been re-appearing in the Indian Ocean Islands. Indeed an unprecedented epidemic occurred in the Réunion Island in 2005-2006 where one third of the total population was infected. The vector responsible of this transmission is the Aedes Albopictus mosquito, also called the Asian tiger mosquito (Reiter et al., 2006). Today, we know that many factors have influenced and facilitated the epidemic to occur and spread. Recent researches have suggested, in particular during the Réunion Island epidemic of 2006, that the transmission by Aedes albopictus had been facilitated by genetic mutations of the virus and the vector capacity to adapt to non-tropical regions. Moreover, there is no vaccine or specific treatment and the main measures to limit the number of infections are the control of the vector proliferation and individual protection against mosquito bites. In tis context, the mathematical modeling appears to be a major tool for studying and best understanding the evolution of such disease. 

Models help us taking decisions and direct
control efforts.
We first present biological characteristics about the vector and the virus transmission to human
population. Then models are proposed and studied (ordinary differential equations, delay differential
equations, optimal control) describing the mosquito population dynamics, based on the biological life
cycle (eggs/larvae/pupae/adult) using stage structured models. These models are then integrated in a
transmission virus model, described thanks to a SI-SIR epidemiological model. Different scenarios and
control strategies, including control technics, that may be applied to limit the number of infection and
the vector proliferation, are studied.
Then a metapopulation model including human and vector displacements is formulated and studied in
the case of the Réunion Island, where the environment is modeled using a network. Finally a comparison
and validation of these models are given, based on the real seroprevalence data observed in the Réunion
Island and obtained from the INVS (the French institution for public health watching).
